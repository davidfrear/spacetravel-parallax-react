        <p>How much does a ticket to space cost? That depends on who you book with, how you want to get there and whether you get lucky or not.
            On the day that billionaire Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos goes to space it’s worth knowing that a ticket to reach space 
            can cost as much as $55 million for a “proper” orbital flight and a visit to the International Space Station (ISS)—and as little as 
            nothing at all. Can you really get to space for free? Sure you can, by entering a competition to win Virgin Galactic tickets via 
            Omaze.com. As space tourism flights on Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic get scheduled, likely in 2022, look out for more competitions.
