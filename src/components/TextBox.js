        <h3>The Future Looks Bright</h3>
        <p>Zero-gravity aircraft trips are now becoming more widely available, and other trips using a new kind of vehicle taking people up to very 
            high altitudes should become available within the next few years. And the Shuttle fleet, now becoming privatized, could carry a very 
            few of our general public to orbit every year for general public space tourism research and merchandising purposes. To move beyond this 
            to generally available trips to orbit and week-long stays in LEO hotels now can be seen as certainly feasible, and some of the required 
            basic space transportation and habitation technological-operational advances required to do so are already underway.
